> It's recommended and preferred to add a unit test for a new function.
Don't worry if you don't manage to write one. Contribution is still appreciated

## If adding a new function, it …
- [ ] only uses ES module syntax
- [ ] has a valid JSDoc comment
- [ ] has a unit test in a subfolder like: `__tests__/function.test.js`

## My changes …
- [ ] still make the current tests pass with `npm test`
